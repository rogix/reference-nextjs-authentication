This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) boilerplate project created to help you start your next project easily.

In order to create a project with Next.js we need some  tools like eslint, prettier, some testing library etc. This can be cumbersome and require lot of time to make it done.

This ,obviously, is a very opinionated configuration. I use this tools in some projects, so I decided to make it easy.

The tools used in this projects are:

- [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - one of the best react framework out there
- [Chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) - great tool to create React.js components.
- [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) - for unit testing
- [MSW](https://github.com/mswjs/msw) - to mocking data
- [Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook) - help us document our components with joy
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) - git hooks made easy and nice
- [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) - the best thing after pamonha
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) - help us make our code organized
